Given a collection of points in the plane and a specified threshold value "s," this program determines the number of connected groups in the graph formed by these input points. It employs a fast and optimized approach to identify clusters of points that are within a distance of "s" from each other, effectively analyzing the connectivity of the point set. This project provides a versatile solution for various applications, such as network analysis, clustering, and spatial data processing.
