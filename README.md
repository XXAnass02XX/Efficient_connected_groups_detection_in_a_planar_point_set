'''Given a collection of points in the plane and a specified threshold value "s," this program determines the number of connected groups in the graph formed by these input points. It employs a fast and optimized approach to identify clusters of points that are within a distance of "s" from each other, effectively analyzing the connectivity of the point set. This project provides a versatile solution for various applications, such as network analysis, clustering, and spatial data processing.'''

To try the program you can execute the connectes.py file followed by the name of the example file.
